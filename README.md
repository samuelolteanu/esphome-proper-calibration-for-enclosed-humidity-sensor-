Most of the time, a temperature sensor can be calibrated fast and accurate enough by an offset. With humidity, however, it's a different story.
This repo represents my effort in having humidity calibration by temperature offset for low end sensors like AHT20.
Example of sensors that do have this feature already: BME680 with BSEC, SCD40.
